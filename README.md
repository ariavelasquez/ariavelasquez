### Hey y'all, I'm Aria (she/her). 👋🏽

I'm a journalist based in Chicago. I write a newsletter called Labor Pains. In my past lives I've been many things, and in my future lives I'll be many more things. Right now, I'm just a girl trying to learn Python and R with Steven Universe episodes playing in the background.

🤔 I’m looking for help with: learning Python and how to scrape federal databases.
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: stories about labor, unions and work.
💬 Ask me about: Real Housewives and the Celebreality era of VH1. I have thoughts.
