### Hey y'all, I'm Aria (she/her). 👋🏽

I'm a journalist based in Chicago. I write a newsletter called Labor Pains. In my past lives I've been many things, and in my future lives I'll be many more things. Right now, I'm just a girl trying to learn R with Steven Universe episodes playing in the background.
